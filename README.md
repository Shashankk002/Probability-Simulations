# Probability Simulations

A personal collection of small  simulations that explore probability, randomness, and decision-making. Built to satisfy mathematical curiosity and learn-by-doing.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. 🪙 Coin Bias Estimation
Estimate the hidden bias of a coin using:
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Bayesian Inference with Beta distribution
- Rolling estimations and visualizations

### 2. 🚪 Monty Hall Problem Simulation
Simulate the classic "Let's Make a Deal" game show:
- Understand counterintuitive probability
- Compare switching vs staying strategies
- Visualize results over thousands of runs


## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
